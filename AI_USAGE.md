# AI Usage Documentation

This document shows how I used AI tools in this project.

## AI Tool Used

- **Cursor with Claude** (AI coding assistant)

## 1. Creating Mock Data

**What I needed:** Realistic data for an artist dashboard (releases, sales, fan metrics).

**How AI helped:**
- I asked AI to generate mock data for a music artist
- AI created TypeScript interfaces and realistic sample data
- This includes: releases list, sales numbers, fan metrics, and top countries

**Result:** AI saved me a lot of time. Creating realistic mock data manually would take much longer.

## 2. Creating Theme Color Variables

**What I needed:** A color theme for the whole project using EVEN brand colors.

**How AI helped:**
- I gave AI the brand color (red #dc3228) and asked for a dark theme
- AI created all the CSS variables in globals.css
- This includes: background, foreground, card, border, and chart colors

**Result:** The color system is consistent across all components. AI helped me set up the theme structure quickly.

## Summary

AI helped me speed up development by generating mock data and theme variables. These are repetitive tasks that take time but don't need creative decisions. I focused my time on building the components and user experience.
